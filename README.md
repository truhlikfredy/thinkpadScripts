# thinkpadScripts

Some scripts I use to tune / tweak some aspects of thinkpad laptops I own. Powersaving, battery charging threasholds, SSD tuning, trackpoint sensitivity etc...

Primarily this should act as my backup, but if you will find something useful in these, fell free to use them as you wish. But be warned you might damage your hardware with these. Few things are very low level like changing voltage settings for CPU frequencies, which are not just very specific to the CPU my t400 has, but even for the very specific model I currently own. I had couple T400s and all of them got different results when I benchmarked them for the lowest voltages.
